## Types of Maturity Models

### No MLOps Highlights
- **Challenges:**
  - Difficult to manage the full machine learning model lifecycle.
  - Teams are disparate and releases are painful.
  - Most systems exist as "black boxes," providing little feedback during/post-deployment.
- **Technology:**
  - Manual builds and deployments.
  - Manual testing of models and applications.
  - No centralized tracking of model performance.
  - Training of models is manual.

### DevOps but No MLOps Highlights
- **Challenges:**
  - Releases are less painful but rely heavily on the Data Team for every new model.
  - Limited feedback on model performance in production.
  - Difficult to trace and reproduce results.
- **Technology:**
  - Automated builds for software components.
  - Automated tests for application code (unit tests, integration tests).
  - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
  - Basic operational metrics (e.g., request counts, latency).

### Automated Training (2-3 ML Cases) Highlights
- **Benefits:**
  - Training environment is fully managed and traceable.
  - Easy to reproduce models.
  - Releases are manual but with low friction.
- **Technology:**
  - Automated model training scripts or pipelines.
  - Centralized tracking of model training performance and experiment tracking.
  - Model management tools to handle different model versions.

### Automated Model Deployment Highlights
- **Benefits:**
  - Releases are low friction and automated.
  - Full traceability from deployment back to the original data.
  - The entire environment is managed, from training to testing to production.
- **Technology:**
  - Integrated A/B testing of model performance for deployment decisions.
  - Automated tests for all code, including model and data pipeline code.
  - Centralized tracking of model training performance.
  - Model deployment platforms that support automated and scalable model serving.

### Full MLOps Automated Operations Highlights
- **Benefits:**
  - The full system is automated and easily monitored.
  - Production systems provide feedback for continuous improvement.
  - Approaching a zero-downtime system.
- **Technology:**
  - Automated model training, testing, and deployment pipelines.
  - Verbose, centralized metrics and monitoring for deployed models.
  - Automated feedback loops and model retraining based on performance degradation.
  - Model registry integrated with deployment and monitoring systems.

## Detailed Levels and Practices

### Level 0: No MLOps
- **People:**
  - Data scientists, data engineers, and software engineers work in silos.
  - No regular communication between teams.
- **Model Creation:**
  - Data gathered manually.
  - Compute resources likely unmanaged.
  - Experiments not predictably tracked.
  - End result is a single model file manually handed off with inputs/outputs.
- **Model Release:**
  - Manual process, often by data scientists or data engineers.
  - Scoring scripts created manually, not version-controlled.
  - Releases are manual each time.
- **Application Integration:**
  - Heavily reliant on data scientist expertise to implement.
  - Manual releases each time.

### Level 1: DevOps but No MLOps

## Summary
- The MLOps maturity model provides a framework for assessing and improving the automation and collaboration practices in machine learning projects.
- Organizations should aim to progress through these levels based on their specific needs and use cases, ensuring they implement the right practices and technologies at each stage.
- The goal is to achieve a balance between automation, scalability, and maintainability to ensure robust and reliable ML systems.
