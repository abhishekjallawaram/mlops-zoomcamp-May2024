## Module 1: Model Training Process

### Refactoring Code into Functions

- Consolidate code into reusable functions to improve readability and maintainability.
- Example: Create a function for loading and preprocessing data.

### Tracking Models and Parameters

- Keep track of different models and their parameters during experimentation.
- Use a systematic approach to record performance metrics.

### Using Experiment Tracking Tools

- Implement tools like MLflow to log experiments and track model performance over time.
- Preserve the history of experiments for reproducibility.

## Module 2: Benefits of Experiment Tracking and Model Management

### Saving Model Metrics

- Save metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall in an experiment tracker.
- Ensure metrics are easily accessible for future reference.

### Using a Model Registry

- Store models along with their metadata and performance metrics in a model registry.
- Facilitate easy retrieval and comparison of models.

## Module 3: Reasons for ML Pipelines

### Decomposing Notebooks into Steps

- Break down notebooks into modular steps like data loading, preprocessing, and model training.
- Improve organization and readability.

### Creating ML Pipelines

- Develop pipelines to automate the sequence of steps in the machine learning workflow.
- Ensure consistency and reproducibility.

### Tools for Creating Pipelines

- Use tools such as Prefect and Kubeflow to create and manage ML pipelines.
- Enhance scalability and robustness of the workflow.

## Module 4: Model Deployment

### Deploying Models as Web Services

- Deploy models as web services to make them accessible to end-users or applications.
- Implement REST APIs for model interaction.

### Different Deployment Options

- Explore various deployment options such as cloud services, on-premises servers, and edge devices.
- Choose the best deployment strategy based on the use case.

## Module 5: Model Monitoring

### Monitoring Model Performance

- Continuously monitor model performance to ensure it remains accurate and reliable.
- Track metrics like latency, throughput, and prediction accuracy.

### Setting Up Alerts

- Set up alerts to notify stakeholders when model performance drops below a certain threshold.
- Implement automated alerting systems.

### Automating Retraining and Deployment

- Automate the process of retraining and deploying models when performance degrades.
- Use CI/CD pipelines to streamline these operations.

## Module 6: Best Practices

### Writing Maintainable Code

- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code to facilitate collaboration and maintenance.
- Follow coding standards and best practices.

### Packaging with Docker

- Package applications and dependencies using Docker for consistent and reproducible environments.
- Simplify deployment and scaling processes.

### Automating Training Processes

- Automate training processes to reduce manual intervention and improve efficiency.
- Implement scripts and tools to manage the entire training pipeline.

## Module 7: Processes

### Collaboration Between Teams

- Foster collaboration between data scientists, machine learning engineers, and other stakeholders.
- Use tools and processes to streamline communication and workflow.

### Ensuring Project and Code Ownership

- Define clear ownership of code and projects to ensure accountability and maintain quality.
- Implement version control and code review processes.

### Understanding Problem-Solving Approaches

- Develop a thorough understanding of the problem at hand and the desired outcomes.
- Use structured approaches to problem-solving to improve effectiveness and efficiency.
